## How to use
### Launching
```
git clone https://github.com/e-sence/docker.git ./
cd docker-symfony-skeleton/docker
docker-compose -p symfony up
```

---

### Shutdown
Stops containers and removes containers, networks, volumes, and images created by `up`.
- `docker-compose -p symfony down`

---

### Container information
Display detailed information on network
- `docker network inspect symfony_default`

---

### Prune containers
When you stop a container, it is not automatically removed unless you started it with the `--rm` flag. To see all containers on the Docker host, including stopped containers, use `docker ps -a`. You may be surprised how many containers exist, especially on a development system! A stopped containerâ€™s writable layers still take up disk space. To clean this up, you can use the docker container prune command.
- `docker builder prune`
